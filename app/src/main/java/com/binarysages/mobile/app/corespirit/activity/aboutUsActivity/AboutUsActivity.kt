            "CORE SPIRIT is a movement aspiring to raise the collective consciousness and enhance the human race, a possibility to get better in every aspect of life for the humanity on all levels: Individual, Family, Society, Humanity, Earth, Universe &amp; God.

CS became not just a hobby but a profession when the founders started to think the platform through to the smallest details and came up with its integral parts — articles, events, market place and Entrepreneurial Mentor.</p><p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph\">Today, CS is actively building up its audience from all over the world coming to learn about different practices and to start living to the fullest – with an open heart and mind.
